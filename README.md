***The movies_db database and tables ('imdb_ratings', 'golden_globe', 'imdb_movies') are created in Postgres database before running the movies_etl.ipynb code. 

4. All extraction, transformation and loading code is in movies_etl.ipynb (Jupiter notebook)
***The config file has the Postgres db password and is to be updated before running the movies_etl.ipynb (Jupiter nb)

5. Visualisations/ graphs are in Visualisations folder
